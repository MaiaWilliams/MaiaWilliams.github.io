description: <p>I am a spatial data analyst based in Perth, Western Australia.</p> <p>I enjoy the diversity of contexts and the multidiscplinary opportunities my spatial data passion affords me. I thrive on continual learning and teaching of spatial analysis possibilities and the small pleasures of new tricks. I am excited by open source projects like QGIS, OpenStreetMap, Wikidata and many more from the FOSS4G world.</p> <p>This page is a for collecting projects I've worked on.</p> <p>Find more about my work history and education on [LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/maia-williams-4237314a)</p>

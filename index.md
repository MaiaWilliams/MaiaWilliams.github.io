description: I am a spatial data analyst based in Perth, Western Australia. I enjoy the diversity of contexts and the multidiscplinary opportunities my spatial data passion affords me. I thrive on continual learning and teaching of spatial analysis possibilities and the small pleasures of new tricks. I am excited by open source projects like QGIS, OpenStreetMap, Wikidata and many more from the FOSS4G world. <br/>This page is a for collecting projects I've worked on. <br/>Find more about my work history and education on [LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/maia-williams-4237314a)

### Spatial data resources for landscape architects
Resources developed for UWA landscape architecture students and practising landspace architects/environmental scientists. These documents are a continual work in progress, not yet polished and in need of collation ... but often useful. I use these documents when guest teaching at landscape architecture design studios or helping practices with GIS training.
- [Site analysis resources](Documents/SpatialDataForLandscapeArchitects_Resources/20230227_MaiaWilliams_SiteAnalysisResources.pdf) (spatial and non-spatial data sources).
- [Preparing and importing base data into AutoCAD](Documents/SpatialDataForLandscapeArchitects_Resources/20230227_MaiaWilliams_BaseDataIntoCAD_Notes.pdf).
- [Working with vector data in QGIS](Documents/SpatialDataForLandscapeArchitects_Resources/20230227_MaiaWilliams_WorkingwithShapefilesandGeopackagesinQGIS_Notes.pdf).
- [More advanced QGIS and data analysis notes](Documents/SpatialDataForLandscapeArchitects_Resources/20230504_MaiaWilliams_GeneralQGISNotes.pdf).
- [Preparing AutoCAD files for printing and export to Illustrator](Documents/SpatialDataForLandscapeArchitects_Resources/20230227_MaiaWilliams_AutoCAD_Printing_and_Importing_to_Illustrator.pdf).
  
### Open source projects
#### Geogeeks and FOSS4G, 2021 -  
I help organise [Geogeeks](https://geogeeks.org/) events. Geogeeks is a community group for people interested in open source tools and data for geospatial. We run regular hack nights, speaker events and OpenStreetMap mapping days. There are drinks, pizza, like minded people, urban exploring, nerdy spatial speak - the best!

In 2021 I helped organised the [FOSS4G SotM Oceania Perth Hub](https://foss4g-perth.org/) conference. This was a local event coniciding with other regional Oceania conference hubs. It was fantastic, we'll do it again one another year.

#### Wikimedia Australia Wikidata Fellowship project, 2022 -
In 2022 I participated in a mentored fellowship focussed on developing a method for the semi-automated use of Wikidata population values in Australian place Wikipedia article infoboxes. With (a lot of!) support I developed a Lua module to aid this workflow.
- August 2023, [Wikimania](https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2023:Wikimania) conference presentation
- February 2023, Wikimedia East, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Regional Cooperation (ESEAP) [Hub meeting](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/ESEAP_Hub/Meetings/12_February_2023) presentation: [Populating Wikipedia: Keeping population figures up-to-date in place articles](Documents/20230212_MaiaWilliams_ESEAP_PopulatingWikipedia_Presentation.pptx)
- July 2022, Wikimedia Australia blog post: [Populating Wikipedia: New tool integrating Australian Census data, 21 July 2022](https://wikimedia.org.au/wiki/Populating_Wikipedia:_New_tool_integrating_Australian_Census_data)
- July 2022, Lua module for Wikipedia: [PopulationFromWikidata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:PopulationFromWikidata)

### Dissertations and university projects
#### Master of Landscape Architecture dissertation, University of Western Australia, 2020
My Master of Landscape Architecture dissertation was about the processes of urban landscape perception and how purposefully designing for these processes might influence urban design. There is a theoretical research component (Part 1) and a loosely connected hypothetical suburb design demonstration (Part 2). Part 1 is far more interesting than Part 2, but both are here.
- [Part 1: Such possibilities in the processes of place.](Documents/20200618_MaiaWilliams_UWA_MasterLA_DissertationPart1_SuchPossibilitiesInTheProcessesofPlace.pdf)
- [Part 2: Living. Beside the ridge, before the sea.](Documents/20201029_MaiaWilliams_UWA_MasterLA_DissertationPart2_Living-BesidetheRidge_BeforetheSea.pdf)

#### Master of Landscape Architecture design studio, University of Western Australia, 2019
My final year design studio was a combination of data gathering and design using [Jan Gehl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Gehl)'s street quality and public life analysis methods (all credit to Pip Munckton and Chantal Caruso for the studio design). Just the right studio for me.
- [What if? Beaufort Street](Documents/191031_MaiaWilliams_UWA_LACH4424Studio_BeaufortStreetDesign.pdf).

#### Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, 2011
My dissertation research was about the categories of landforms people identify and why the categories vary between landscapes. I was studying in Portugal and Germany, and did my dissertation research in Portugal. I published my research in the Journal of Spatial Information Science (JOSIS).
- [Contribution towards understanding the categorisation of landforms](https://run.unl.pt/handle/10362/5614) dissertation.
- [The influence of landscape variation on landform categorization](https://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/view/30) JOSIS article.

#### Bachelor of Engineering (Environmental) Honours, University of Western Australia, 2006
For the sake of completeness I include my honours dissertation here! I did this project the year after I first fell in love with spatial data analysis and I was so pleased to find an honours project that was essentially a remote sensing analysis.
- [A farm scale site selection method for dryland forestry](Documents/20061030_MaiaWilliams_UWA_EnvEngHonours_Dissertation.pdf).
